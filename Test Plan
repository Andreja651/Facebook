1. Introduction
This document defines the End-to-End (E2E) test plan for the core user authentication flows: Registration, Sign In, and Sign Out. The goal is to verify these workflows from a real customer's perspective using manual test documentation only.

2. Objectives
Verify that new users can register using valid and unique credentials- Ensure proper error handling during registration (e.g., already used email)- Confirm that users can sign in with valid credentials- Ensure sign-in fails with incorrect or malformed input- Validate successful sign-out and session termination behavior

3. In scope features
- User Registration
- User Sign In
- User Sign Out

Out of Scope
- Password reset or recovery flows
- Third-party authentication (Google, Facebook, etc.)
- Session timeout behavior across pages
- Admin or staff user roles

4. Test approach
- Manual E2E testing only
- No automation or backend validation
- UI-driven, using browser and form inputs
- Test coverage will include both positive and negative paths

5. Key scenarios (Covered with examples)

1. Registration: New user registers with valid email, password 
2. Registration: User attempts registration with already registered email
3. Sign In: User logs in with valid credentials 
4. Sign In: User tries to sign in with wrong password 
5. Sign Out: User signs out and is redirected to login page

6. Assumptions

- The test environment is stable and reflects production behavior
- All backend services required (e.g., account creation, auth) are functional
- No email verification is required to test successful registration
- Testers act as real users using UI forms and buttons only

7. Risk and Mitigation 

Risk: Registration fails due to backend 
 Mitigation: Limit testing to front-end validation scope

Risk: Incomplete form validations
 Mitigation: Note as defect and include in Bug Report

Risk: Browser incompatibility 
Mitigation: Limit testing to Chrome (unless stated)

8. Deliverables

- Test Plan (this document)
- Test Scenarios & Test Cases 
- Bug Reports 
- Final Test Summary Report
- Optional Screenshots for validation
